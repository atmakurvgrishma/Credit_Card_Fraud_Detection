# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Machine learning algorithms are able to detect potentially fraudulent  behavior with considerable accuracy and effectiveness by analysing patterns and anomalies  across a wide range of datasets. In this project, we will utilize four different machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of credit card fraud based on the provided features. A successful detection of credit card fraud through machine learning could lead to reduced financial losses and improve overall safety in the use of cards.  

## Objective : 
- To detect fraudulent activities in credit card transactions and predict the result. 
- Compare some efficient machine learning algorithms, find better accuracy, and suggest a model. 
- Visualize dataset through model graphs using Python libraries. 
- Integrate machine learning model in the web-based framework for better user interface and user experience.
- To develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. 
- To integrate the selected machine learning model with the Streamlit web framework to create a user-friendly and interactive interface for fraud detection. 
- To provide a reliable and secure fraud detection system that can be deployed to production environments such as web servers or mobile applications.
